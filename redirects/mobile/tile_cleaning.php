		    <strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
		  <p>Over time tiny scratches develop in your tiles which act as hiding places for dirt, oils and bacteria.</p>
		  <p>Due to grout being porous – it attracts and absorbs any type of moisture, such as oils, acids, sugars and proteins. The moisture then attracts bacteria, which starts to look unsightly over time.</p>
		  <p><strong>So will your Grout look as good as new after tile and grout cleaning?</strong></p>
		  <p>The reality is nothing will ever be as good as new after it has been used. However, we are fully trained and confident that you will love the look of your tiles and our professional tile and grout cleaning system.</p>
		  <h2>You will love the result.</h2>
		  <p><strong>Important.</strong></p>
		  <p>When considering a tile and grout cleaning company in Perth, you need to be aware of operators who use harsh chemicals that use high alkaline caustic detergents.</p>
		  <p>If not flushed, rinsed and neutralised effectively, these chemicals can easily remove paint from surfaces or chemically burn surrounding carpets.</p>
		  <p>At The Ultimate Clean we proudly use environmentally friendly, neutral and biodegradable cleaning products whenever possible. Importantly, they reduce any chance of damage to your surrounding furniture.</p>
		  <h2>You can relax knowing that your home or work environment is safe.</h2>
		  <p><strong>Do you have wooden inlay in your tiles?</strong></p>
		  <p>No problem as we are fully trained in all hard floor cleaning and care.</p>
		  <p><strong>Got a stain in your natural stone floor?</strong></p>
		  <p>We can remove most stains such as red wine, oil etc.</p>
		  <p>We test every job before we start to determine the type of material that we are dealing with.</p>
		  <p>Sanded grout, un-sanded grout, epoxy grout, ceramic, terracotta, terrazzo, quarry, concrete, natural stone, granite, marble, slate, limestone, sandstone  - all require different processes and cleaning products.</p>
		  <p>Untrained cleaners can easily get it wrong – using acid on natural stone floors can etch the marble chips and leave little etched circles all over the floor…</p>
		  <p>If water pressures are not controlled, grout can be removed from the lines…tiles can even be cracked!</p>
		  <h2>That’s why it is essential that you choose a professionally trained tile cleaner. </h2>
		  <p><strong>You will love our new air movers!</strong></p>
		  <p>Our new air movers dry your tiles within minutes allowing you can walk on them immediately.</p>
