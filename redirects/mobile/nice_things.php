		  <p>Thank you for organising both the carpet removal and cleaning of our unit.</p>
		  <p>I had to go out there for a measure and quote for new carpets on Saturday and the place is so clean you’d never know there was a sewage leak less than a fortnight ago.</p>
		  <p> I appreciate your help with everything and will definitely be recommending the Ultimate Clean to people.</p>
		  <p><strong>Shelley (Success)</strong></p>
		  <p>Just wanted to thank you for the great job you did at our home on Tuesday.</p>
		  <p>My wife was very impressed with your professionalism and approach.</p>
		  <p>When I arrived home from work that afternoon, I could clearly see the difference cleaning the tiles had made.</p>
		  <p>We are very happy with the result.</p>
		  <p> Kind Regards <strong>John &amp; Andrea (Coogee)</strong></p>
		  <p>Brett did a great job which I really appreciate.</p>

		    Hi Brett,<br />
		    <br />
		    Thank you for your time, kindness &amp; generosity in addressing the remaining stain left by my previous carpet cleaner.<br />
		    <br />
		    Thanks for explaining the technical side of the cleaning process and reassuring me that the stains should not resurface with the next clean.<br />
		    <br />
		    Best Regards<br />
		    <br />

		    I did enjoy the service you and your Ultimate Clean Crew provided. It was a fantastic experience which I have shared with friends already. You guys rock when it comes to professionalism &amp; services provided. I look forward to doing business with you again in the future. We received confirmation yesterday our bond will be returned in full!</p>

		  <p>I had little hope of getting our commercial carpet cleaned in our office because of the poor state it was in. Then I was referred to Ultimate Clean. I can't recommend them high enough. It was a challenge the technician took on with enthusiasm. We could not be happier.<br />

		  <p>Thought I would pass this onto you. Thanks for all your help on this one… “clean was amazing I have high standards Brett and his ultimate clean crew exceeded this. We have already received notice from our property manager that the bond will be returned to us in full”.</p>

		  <p>Dear Brett &amp; Kellie and the whole team at The Ultimate Clean<br />
		    Very Happy Christmas and all the best for the New Year.<br />
		    Thanks for all your support this year. We really appreciate you looking after our customers cleaning requirements and the great service you provide.</p>
	    <p>From all at Grace<br />

		  <p>Thank you, and by the way you did an awesome job!<br />

	    <p>Thanks. The carpet came up beautifully.<br />
	      <strong>Clare (Alfred Cove)</strong></p>
		  <p>Thank you so very much for your super speedy help today with cleaning up my daughter's unfortunate chocolate sick from my brand new wool carpet.</p>
		  <p>I had rung 7 different companies and was dismissed by them all - it left me feeling frustrated and very disappointed.</p>
		  <p>From the moment I spoke to you on the phone I felt calm and hopeful that I would not be left with terrible stains on my bedroom carpet. You advised me how to prepare it for your cleaning and gave me a time when I should expect you.</p>
		  <p>I was pleased when you phoned me back with an even earlier time slot and then appreciated your professional manner and thorough approach.</p>
		  <p>I cannot believe how good the carpet looks now! If I had not taken Photos I don't think anyone would believe how it looked BEFORE you worked your magic!!</p>
		  <p>Thank you so much for helping me out today and being so helpful, friendly and good at your job.</p>
		  <p>I will definitely be recommending you!</p>
		  <p>Kind regards<br />

		  <p>On Wednesday 1st February Brett came to our home in Ferndale and cleaned our carpets, what a great job he did, his whole approach to the job was very professional and I will definitely be recommending him and The Ultimate Clean to family and friends.</p>

		  <p>Just a quick note to say the job done at Wall St Maylands was fantastic.<br />

		  <p>Thank you so much for helping me out with my new house. It has been so lovely to come into such a clean house and to be able now to concentrate simply on unpacking and making it home.</p>
		  <p>My sincere thanks to everyone who has helped to make this possible for us.<br />
		    <strong>Kelly (Atwell) </strong><br />
		    You came in and cleaned our apartment for us at 24/35 Esplanade, Nedlands, yesterday.</p>
		  <p>We just wanted to say a big thank you for your work. It looks fantastic and I am quite sure the landlord will be extremely pleased with the standard of clean.</p>
		  <p>I will definitely be using you in to the future and am happy for you to use me as a reference or recommendation in to the future if need be.</p>
