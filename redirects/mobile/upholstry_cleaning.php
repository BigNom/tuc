		  <h2>Our professional upholstery cleaning Perth procedure:</h2>
		  <p>The Ultimate Clean has a 7 step cleaning process which enables the best Upholstery Clean available in Perth. Every step is designed to get your upholstery sparkling clean and help it to stay clean for longer.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 1. Pre-inspection and dye migration test.</strong></p>
		  <p>We make sure the fabric is colour fast and assess any tears or deterioration.</p>
		  <p><strong> Step 2. Pre-vacuum.</strong></p>
		  <p>An essential step in Upholstery cleaning, we use a purpose designed hand piece on a powerful vacuum system to remove hairs and fine soil from the upholstery before cleaning.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 3. Pre-treatment.</strong></p>
		  <p>A cleaning agent is applied to the upholstery to assist the breakdown of oils which accumulate from our skin and even the oil from your pet’s fur.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 4. Hand Scrub.</strong></p>
		  <p>A pre-treatment is not enough to completely break down the oils in the fabric. We hand scrub the fabric with a horse hair brush or microfiber glove designed specifically for cleaning your family’s Upholstery.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 5. Extraction Rinse.</strong></p>
		  <p>Our powerful hot truck-mount upholstery cleaner is then used to flush out the dirt and cleaning agents from your upholstery achieving tempretures around 130oC. Extra drying passes are performed for quick drying.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 6. Fabric Protector.</strong></p>
		  <p>We can apply an Anti-Soiling protector on the furniture after cleaning. This helps to repel the oils on the skin and helps the upholstery stay cleaner for longer!</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 7. High speed air mover.</strong></p>
		  <p>Our air mover is placed into position to help with the drying process after cleaning.</p>
