		  <p>Residents in Melville now have The Ultimate Clean in their area - we will clean your carpets to the Australian and New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 3733. By choosing a company that follows these steps, you ensure that your carpets are healthier, fresher and cleaner, and guaranteed to stay cleaner for longer.</p>
		  <p>Should price be the driving force when choosing carpet cleaning? Since only 10% of carpet cleaners Perth are professionally trained, if you want real value for your money in Melville, carpet cleaning by someone who is professionally trained and accredited and can actually clean your carpets correctly is essential. This means thoroughly pre vacuuming the carpets, using a crevice tool to vacuum the edges, as well using a powerful upright vacuum with a HEPA filter to help reduce the risk of respiratory health concerns because your carpet acts as a filter and needs to be cleaned regularly … all before the actual clean begins.</p>
		  <p>At The Ultimate Clean we are so confident that you will love dealing with us and love the results of your carpet clean that you’ll tell your friends about our carpet cleaning. Melville residents also love our Tile and Grout Cleaning and our Upholstery Cleaning. In fact we have been told by many of our customers that we are now their carpet cleaning company for life because not only we clean carpets really well but we also take care of their leather lounge, Mattresses, Rugs and any flood / water damage restoration work.</p>

We have the latest and hottest truck mounted steam cleaning equipment (Sapphire 370ss), efficient low moisture cleaning equipment (Orbot Sprayborg) on the market and the highest level training in the industry, why would you choose anybody else with the health and appearance of your carpets.</p>
