<h3>The Ultimate Carpet Clean Guarantee</h3>
<p class="subheader">
    We guarantee carpet cleaning that will leave your carpet feeling soft and will stay cleaner for longer.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">We have three of the best methods of carpet cleaning in Perth</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carpet Steam Cleaning (Hot Water Extraction)</li>
        <li>Dry Carpet Cleaning (Bonnet Cleaning)</li>
        <li>Encapsulation (Low Moisture Carpet Cleaning)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are many factors that determine which method is right for you.
    <br>
    <br> The Ultimate Cleans team will inspect your carpet prior to cleaning and conduct tests to identify the fibre type, weave, construction, how your carpet is dyed, the backing fabrics and the potential challenges that can occur when applying any chemical
    including water to a fibre – and then we choose the best method to clean and dry your carpets the best way possible.

    <blockquote>Some carpet cleaning companies will have you believe that one system is better than the other. This is incorrect. A professional carpet cleaner should carry all 3 methods in his vehicle and after inspecting your carpet should advise you on which method
        will best suit your needs.

<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">Carpet Cleaners Perth - The Ultimate Clean Way</h3>
<h4 class="subheader">High Filtration Vacuum</h4>
<p>
    Our high-flow vacuum system with HEPA filters – one of the smallest filters available – are the only way to effectively remove the fine soil particles and hairs prior to carpet cleaning, that are not typically removed. You will be amazed by the amount
    of dust we will remove from your carpet by just vacuuming alone. Our high-flow vacuum system is also Hospital Grade and ideal if you suffer from asthma or allergies. The filters capture bacteria, mould and pollen particles as small as .5 microns –
    that is 200 times smaller in diameter than human hair and as small as a single particle of cigarette smoke!
</p>
<h4 class="subheader">Pre-Spray and Pre-Spotting</h4>
<p>
    Our soil suspension solution is sprayed on to target any spotting and soiling, helping to release it from the fibres prior to steam cleaning.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Rotary Agitation</h4>
<p>
    With soft brushes or pads we loosen soiling from the fibre and agitate the pre-spray. This helps the final look of our carpet cleaning and helps to clean your carpet up to 50% better.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Powerful Truck Mounted Machine</h4>
<p>
    For a deep, thorough clean we use a powerful truck mounted extraction system to clean to the base of your carpet fibre, our machine can produce 130oC of hot cleaning solution and 5 times more airflow than portable carpet cleaning machines.
    <br>
    <br> With the power of heat and incredible vacuum airflow, we are also able to kill dust mites, remove pollens ‘living’ in your carpet and extract more water out of your carpet for rapid drying times.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Specialised Stain Removal Systems using the power of Oxy-Action</h4>
<p>
    For persistent or re-occurring stains, you’ll be amazed at our stain removal systems. We use heat transfer methods to increase molecular activity and in turn, helps release the stain from the fibre.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Neutralising Rinse</h4>
<p>
    Our specially formulated neutralising rinse leaves your carpet residue free, and helps your carpet resist soiling, feel softer and stay clean for longer.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Carpet Grooming</h4>
<p>
    Our carpet tool removes wand and swirl marks, separates fibres and resets the pile allowing for maximum airflow and reduced drying times after your carpet has been thoroughly cleaned.
    <br>
    <br> An amazing finishing touch!
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Protective Furniture Tabs</h4>
<p>
    Plastic or foam block tabs placed under furniture lift it off your carpet preventing staining or possible damage during drying.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Rapid Drying Systems</h4>
<p>
    The combination of our high speed air movers, drying bonnets, grooming tools, ‘green’ glides on our wands and powerful truck mounted machines all increase air flow over your carpet fibres
    <br> We understand fast-drying carpet is important so during the truck mounted carpet cleaning process we even have dedicated drying strokes to remove excess water.

<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">The Ultimate Warning about untrained / inexperienced carpet cleaners in Perth</h3>
<p>
    We regularly receive calls from distressed customers asking us to fix a problem usually caused by untrained carpet cleaners in Perth. Typically these issues include the following.
</p>
<ul class="warning-list">
    <li>No pre-vacuuming – dirty streak marks and a very matt look because of the way the carpet dries from base of the fibre to tip, pulling the fine embedding soil particles to the surface of the fibre during the drying process from evaporation.</li>
    <li>Carpets left too wet - woven carpet with cotton (a natural fibre) absorbs water and swells which causes shrinkage or the jute can bleed up to the surface of the fibre's and the carpet in areas can have a brownish water mark called browning, which
        can usually be rectified by us.</li>
    <li>Water pressure too high - can blast the water and dirt right down to the underlay, especially on polypropylene, potentially causing ongoing mould problems and dirty looking carpet.</li>
    <li>Too high alkaline chemical on wool - can burn the wool causing irreversible damage.</li>
    <li>Bleach application to a nylon carpet – strip the colour leaving an unsightly yellow area.</li>
    <li>Too high heat – strip the colour from the carpet fibre.</li>
    <li>Carpet cleaning solutions containing detergents not completely flushed out - stains return quickly, especially in main traffic areas, because detergent is oily in nature and attracts dirt and dust.</li>
</ul>
