<p>The Ultimate Clean is a specialised Carpet, Tile and Upholstery cleaning company with a strong focus on training, communication and results. Our philosophy is, it needs to be done so do it once and doing it right. At The Ultimate Clean we understand that
    cleaning is just another item on your to do list, so we try our best to keep it as simple as possible. We will be prompt but thorough on the phone, book your job to best suit your busy schedule, communicate effectively during the process and payments
    and receipting are as simple a press of a button.</p>

<p>Customers always ask me <strong>"what makes your company different from the other ones?"</strong> My answer is usually about taking the time. It takes time to do things correctly, the process to clean has a formula it is called the CHAT PIE the pie is broken into quarters
    Chemical, Heat, Agitation and Time. If This process is followed using the correct chemicals, equipment and knowledge the results can be exceptional.</p>
