                    The most wonderful job done at our place, on this first experience with Brett he rescheduled work to fit in an urgent job, fantastic & instant communications, great care taken with a range of carpets & rugs, some vintage & antique (but willing to recommend
                    other more specialist rug cleaners). A rare time when I have rung a service & had 100% confidence in them from the first phonecall, so much so that trusted them to lock & leave my house whilst I returned to the country. Got back to
                    find everything optimal, carpet & rugs have never looked so good, everything locked back up exactly as per instruction with complete liason at every step. Very happy. Thank you so much Brett!

                    These guys did a great job on our old carpets. I didn't think there would be a lot they could do but they managed to get so many old stains out making it look fresh and lovely :) they were recommended by a family member and i will pass the recommendation
                    on to any one who il looking for a professional clean.

                    Knew our sofa & chairs would be a challenge after a previous clean that was more than a disaster but after Brett came today, have to say his company has the right name. The Ultimate Clean it was - he is so professional & a perfectionist just like me -
                    beyond happy.
