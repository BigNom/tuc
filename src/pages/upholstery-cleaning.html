<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">The Ultimate Clean 7 Step Procedure</h3>
<h4 class="subheader">Pre-inspection and dye migration test</h4>
<p>We make sure the fabric is colour fast and assess any tears or deterioration.</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Pre-vacuum</h4>
<p>An essential step in Upholstery cleaning, we use a purpose designed hand piece on a powerful vacuum system to remove hairs and fine soil from the upholstery before cleaning.</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Pre-treatment</h4>
<p>A cleaning agent is applied to the upholstery to assist the breakdown of oils which accumulate from our skin and even the oil from your pet’s fur.</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Hand Scrub</h4>
<p>A pre-treatment is not enough to completely break down the oils in the fabric. We hand scrub the fabric with a horse hair brush or microfiber glove designed specifically for cleaning your family’s Upholstery.</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Extraction Rinse</h4>
<p>Our powerful hot truck-mount upholstery cleaner is then used to flush out the dirt and cleaning agents from your upholstery achieving tempreatures around 130oC. Extra drying passes are performed for quick drying.</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Fabric Protector</h4>
<p>We can apply an Anti-Soiling protector on the furniture after cleaning. This helps to repel the oils on the skin and helps the upholstery stay cleaner for longer!</p>

<h4 class="subheader">High speed air mover</h4>
<p>Our air mover is placed into position to help with the drying process after cleaning.</p>
