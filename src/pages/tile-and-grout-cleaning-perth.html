<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">The Ultimate Clean Way</h3>
<h4 class="subheader">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Over time tiny scratches develop in your tiles which act as hiding places for dirt, oils and bacteria. Due to grout being porous – it attracts and absorbs any type of moisture, such as oils, acids, sugars and proteins. The moisture then attracts bacteria,
    which starts to look unsightly over time.</p>
<h4 class="subheader">Pre-Spray and Pre-Spotting</h4>
<p>
    Our soil suspension solution is sprayed on to target any spotting and soiling, helping to release it from the fibres prior to steam cleaning.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Rotary Agitation</h4>
<p>
    With soft brushes or pads we loosen soiling from the fibre and agitate the pre-spray. This helps the final look of our carpet cleaning and helps to clean your carpet up to 50% better.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Powerful Truck Mounted Machine</h4>
<p>
    For a deep, thorough clean we use a powerful truck mounted extraction system to clean to the base of your carpet fibre, our machine can produce 130oC of hot cleaning solution and 5 times more airflow than portable carpet cleaning machines.
    <br>
    <br> With the power of heat and incredible vacuum airflow, we are also able to kill dust mites, remove pollens ‘living’ in your carpet and extract more water out of your carpet for rapid drying times.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Specialised Stain Removal Systems using the power of Oxy-Action</h4>
<p>
    For persistent or re-occurring stains, you’ll be amazed at our stain removal systems. We use heat transfer methods to increase molecular activity and in turn, helps release the stain from the fibre.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Neutralising Rinse</h4>
<p>
    Our specially formulated neutralising rinse leaves your carpet residue free, and helps your carpet resist soiling, feel softer and stay clean for longer.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Carpet Grooming</h4>
<p>
    Our carpet tool removes wand and swirl marks, separates fibres and resets the pile allowing for maximum airflow and reduced drying times after your carpet has been thoroughly cleaned.
    <br>
    <br> An amazing finishing touch!
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Protective Furniture Tabs</h4>
<p>
    Plastic or foam block tabs placed under furniture lift it off your carpet preventing staining or possible damage during drying.
</p>

<h4 class="subheader">Rapid Drying Systems</h4>
<p>
    The combination of our high speed air movers, drying bonnets, grooming tools, ‘green’ glides on our wands and powerful truck mounted machines all increase air flow over your carpet fibres
    <br> We understand fast-drying carpet is important so during the truck mounted carpet cleaning process we even have dedicated drying strokes to remove excess water.

<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">So will your Grout look as good as new after tile and grout cleaning?</h3>
<p>
    The reality is nothing will ever be as good as new after it has been used. However, we are fully trained and confident that you will love the look of your tiles and our professional tile and grout cleaning system.
</p>
<p>When considering a tile and grout cleaning company in Perth, you need to be aware of operators who use harsh chemicals that use high alkaline caustic detergents.</p>

<p>If not flushed, rinsed and neutralised effectively, these chemicals can easily remove paint from surfaces or chemically burn surrounding carpets.</p>

<p>At The Ultimate Clean we proudly use environmentally friendly, neutral and biodegradable cleaning products whenever possible. Importantly, they reduce any chance of damage to your surrounding furniture.</p>

<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">Do you have wooden inlay in your tiles?</h3>
<p>No problem as we are fully trained in all hard floor cleaning and care.</p>

<h3 class="carpet-cleaning-sub-header">Got a stain in your natural stone floor?</h3>
<p>We can remove most stains such as red wine, oil etc.</P>

<p>We test every job before we start to determine the type of material that we are dealing with.</p>

<p>Sanded grout, un-sanded grout, epoxy grout, ceramic, terracotta, terrazzo, quarry, concrete, natural stone, granite, marble, slate, limestone, sandstone - all require different processes and cleaning products.</P>

<p>Untrained cleaners can easily get it wrong – using acid on natural stone floors can etch the marble chips and leave little etched circles all over the floor…</P>

<p>If water pressures are not controlled, grout can be removed from the lines…tiles can even be cracked!</p>
