		  <p>The Ultimate Clean - Carpet Cleaning. Mt Pleasant has a great deal of demolition and construction taking place, which creates more dust than usual being deposited in your carpets. Did you know vacuuming alone removes up to 80% of dry particulate soil by using a powerful upright vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter.<br />
