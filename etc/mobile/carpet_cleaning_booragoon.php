		  <p>We at The Ultimate Clean knows the importance chemistry plays in the cleaning industry, especially while carpet cleaning. Booragoon residents are inteligent, and realise the importance of using a trained, certified and experienced carpet cleaner to professionally clean and neutralise your carpets. We all want to prolong life of our carpets and the improve health of the family. We can help buy removing the nasty pollutants sitting in your carpet, just like a filter that needs cleaning.</p>
		  <p>We can actually save you money, improve the look, feel and the health of your carpets by cleaning your carpet to the Australian and New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 3733.</p>
		  <p>If you think about a coca-cola stain on a woollen carpet, coca-cola is an acid which is about a 3 on the pH scale, a woollen fibre should be neutralised during the cleaning process to between pH-5.5 to 8.5, which helps maintain the integrity of the dye and the fibre to help prevent fading or dye migration. The process to remove a coca-cola stain is to use an alkaline detergent around a pH-10 and then flush with an acid rinse at a pH-4 which will neutralize the high alkaline cleaner, essential to prolonging the look and feel of your beautiful woollen carpets.</p>
		  <p>All fibres are unique in their own right and need to be inspected, tested and identified before the cleaning process should even begin.</p>
	    <p>Before we start the carpet cleaning process we have to work out the fibre type because we need you know the best chemical and the amount to apply to emulsify the dirt from the fibre and ensure the best result is achieved during the carpet cleaning process, using one of the newest, hottest and most powerful truck mounted carpet, tile cleaning machines in the industry. Our (Sapphire 370ss) is also the ideal machine for your Tile &amp; Grout and Carpet Cleaning needs.</p>
